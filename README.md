### In the exercises above you need to capture events and define functions.
### The functions perform actions in response to the events.
### Please go through the code I provided for regexps to see how to define a function that reacts to events (in the code, there are two events: onclick and onmouseover).
### Of course, I expect you to spend time in W3Schools and other Java tutorials to see how a function that responds to an event is defined.
### Happy coding!
