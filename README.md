In the exercises above you need to capture events and define functions.
The functions perform actions in response to the events.
Please go through the code I provided for regexps to see how to define a function that reacts to events (in my sample code, there are two events: onclick and onmouseover). Please note the 004 is a challenging one!

### Of course, I expect you to spend (a considerable amount of) time in W3Schools and other Javascript tutorials to see how to define functions in Javascript. We shall cover more on functions in the next lecture. Happy coding!
